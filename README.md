## AssetBook-3

AssetBook-3 is a desktop application for logistics managers to keep track point-of-contacts' (POCs) contact information, along with their relevant assets. It is meant for those who have too many POCs and assets, and wish to easily retrieve contact details based on name, tag, or asset ID.

## Acknowledgement

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
