## Features

This section documents in detail all the features of *AssetBook*.

Most features of *AssetBook* come in the form of *commands*, which are *specific text inputs* that the user enters to
perform an action in the application. Features fall into two broad categories: those that allow the user to **modify
contact data** and those that are **miscellaneous shortcuts** for convenience.

Colored text that look like the following describe the format of a command.

`add n\NAME p\PHONE e\EMAIL a\ADDRESS [t\TAG]... [A\ASSET]...`

A valid input by the user corresponding to the above will be

`add n\John Doe e\johndoe@example.com a\574 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 p\12345678 A\L293D`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<box type="tip" seamless>

Command words are not case-sensitive, i.e. add = Add = ADD.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the notation used to describe commands**

* Here, `add` is the *command word*, signifying that this adds a new contact to the list of contacts.

* `n\`, `p\`, `e\`, etc. are *prefixes* of *parameters*, signifying the text after them is some data field of the contact.
  They are included in the text that the user should input.

* Text in bold like `NAME` are descriptions of what kind of text should be entered in its place.<br>
  e.g. `n\John Doe` should be entered in place of `n\NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can represent `n\John Doe t\friend` or simply `n\John Doe`.

* Items followed by `...` indicates that it can be entered multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]...` can represent `t\friend`, `t\friend t\colleague`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE`, `p\PHONE n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters not specified by the command format entered by the user will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. The format is `exit`, but the user enters `exit 123`. This will still be interpreted as `exit`.

</box>

After successful execution of a command, some feedback will appear in the [command output box](#navigating-the-gui).
If you enter something that the application did not expect or does not understand, often an *error* message will show
up instead.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**If you are using a PDF version of this document**, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

## Modifying Contact Data

This section contains the details for **modifying commands**, which will modify the asset book.

### Adding a Contact: `add`

Adds a new contact to the system, with 0 or more assets associated with the contact.

Format: `add n\NAME p\PHONE e\EMAIL a\ADDRESS [t\TAG]... [A\ASSET]...`

<box type="tip" seamless>
A person can have any number of tags and assets (including 0).
</box>

#### Example
* Add a new contact associated with the asset `L293D`:<br> 
  `add n\John Doe e\johndoe@example.com a\574 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 p\12345678 A\L293D`

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/example-add-before.png" style="width: 90%;">
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Success

If the example was executed successfully, the following message will appear:<br>
`New person added: John Doe; Phone: 12345678; Email: johndoe@example.com; Address: 574 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10; Tags: []; Assets: [[L293D]]`

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/example-add-after.png" style="width: 90%;">
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Failure

If the example was not executed successfully, the proper syntax of the `add` command will be shown to you instead.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/example-add-after-fail.png" style="width: 90%;">
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Parameters

<box type="info" seamless>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a Contact: `delete`

Delete a contact from the system by specifying its index.

### Saving the data file

---

### Editing the data file

*AssetBook*'s data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/assetbook.json`.<br>
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, *AssetBook* will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the *AssetBook* to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: What if my device does not run a mainstream operating system (not Windows, MacOS or Linux)?<br>
**A**: *AssetBook* will work so long as Java 11 can be installed on your device.

**Q**: Must I specifically use Java 11?<br>
**A**: While it may work on other versions, *AssetBook* is meant to work on Java 11. We cannot guarantee that it works on versions other than Java 11.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and replace the JSON data file it creates with the JSON file from your previous *AssetBook* home folder.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Known Issues and Future Features

#### Multiple Screens
When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.
The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

#### Name Validation
At present, names allow any special character except `\`. This is to allow the user flexibility to include uncommon names
that may include symbols such as `/`, `'` and `-`. As such, the application may accept all manner of gibberish for names.
A remedy is planned for the future to perform more robust checks on names.

#### Scrolling
The astute user will notice that ability to scroll with keyboard is missing from the application's features. This feature
will be implemented in an upcoming release as soon as possible.

#### More Asset Details
Some users may require greater detail about the assets to be recorded. We plan to add features to support adding more
details to assets such as serial number, location, etc.
