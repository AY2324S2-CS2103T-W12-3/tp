### Project: AssetBook3

AssetBook3 allows organisations to easily track sponsors, sponsored assets and point-of-contacts (POCs).

Each sponsor could have multiple POCs assigned by the organisation.

Sponsored assets may have logistical tracking with IDs. Users can search information by sponsors, assets, POCs or tags.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
