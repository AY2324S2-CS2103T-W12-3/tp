### Project: SponsorTracker

SponsorTracker allows organisations to easily track sponsors, sponsored assets and point-of-contacts (POCs). Each sponsor could have multiple POCs and the organisation itself can have people assigned as POCs for each sponsor. Sponsored assets may have logistical tracking with IDs. Can search info by sponsor, asset, POC or tags.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
